### THIS IS DEPRECATED
I am no longer updating this. Instead, I have been contributing to the https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab project.
That project supports a bunch of different formats and I have added the John Lewis Partnership Card format there.
I will keep that up-to-date with all of the stupid ways the JLP decides to mess up their export format (without warning).
The version here is no longer up-to-date and won't work anymore.
