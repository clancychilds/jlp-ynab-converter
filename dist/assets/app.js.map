The site was slower,\n      had reduced functionality and payments would fail, causing several customers to be charged\n      late fees.\n      </div>\n      <div>For those users who make use of the export function to move their data into\n      Personal Finance tools like You Need a Budget (YNAB) or Microsoft Money, the most irritating\n      problem was the loss of OFX-format exports of statements. Instead, the only export now\n      available is some sort of UTF-16LE encoded CSV with a bunch of header rows. When I called\n      JLP Customer Service about this, the uninformed representative told me this was a feature \n      because \"those other formats were old and now you can use PDF\". Ugh.</div>\n      <div>So I made this little tool and hope it can help others. It takes the export from the\n      JLP website and formats it into the YNAB CSV format for download. I might make an OFX version\n      as well if I find the time.\n      </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIntroduction.displayName = 'Introduction';\nIntroduction.propTypes =
