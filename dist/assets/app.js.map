The site was slower,\n      had reduced functionality and payments would fail, causing several customers to be charged\n      late fees.\n      </div>\n      <div>For those users who make use of the export function to move their data into\n      Personal Finance tools like You Need a Budget (YNAB) or Microsoft Money, the most irritating\n      problem was the loss of OFX-format exports of statements. Instead, the only export now\n      available is some sort of UTF-16LE encoded CSV with a bunch of header rows. When I called\n      JLP Customer Service about this, the uninformed representative told me this was a feature \n      because \"those other formats were old and now you can use PDF\". Ugh.</div>\n      <div>So I made this little tool and hope it can help others. It takes the export from the\n      JLP website and formats it into the YNAB CSV format for download. I might make an OFX version\n      as well if I find the time.\n      </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIntroduction.displayName = 'Introduction';\nIntroduction.propTypes = {};\nIntroduction.defaultProps = {};\n\nexport default cssmodules(Introduction, styles);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./components/Introduction.js","import React from 'react';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport configureStore from '../stores';\nimport App from '../containers/App';\n\nconst store = configureStore();\n\nclass ReduxApp extends React.Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Provider store={store}>\n        <App />\n      </Provider>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nReduxApp.displayName = 'ReduxApp';\nReduxApp.propTypes = {};\nReduxApp.defaultProps = {};\n\nexport default ReduxApp;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./components/ReduxApp.js","/* CAUTION: When using the generators, this file is modified in some places.\n *          This is done via AST traversal -
